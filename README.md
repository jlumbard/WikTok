# WikipediaRecommender

WikTok is a recommender engine & frontend for wikipedia. 

Wikipedia is one of the greatest online tools in this era, yet its navigation and article recommendation is all but nonexistant. Our team believes that with the power of a recommender like TikTok, Wikipedia could thrive.
